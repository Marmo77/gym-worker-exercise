## ❗ INFO  ❗
- This was my first bigger project with React that use more complicated pages and logics, so it is not perfect, before finishing it I already
see some things i could do better (start with building website based on database, not connecting it on last moment,
using shadcn components, not mixing it with my custom components, I changed the color schema of shadcn basic and use some colors like text-admin ☠️, etc.)
- I am not a professional, so I am still learning, and I am open to any kind and feedback🥰.
