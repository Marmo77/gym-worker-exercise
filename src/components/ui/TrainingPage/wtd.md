# WHAT TO DO TO MAKE IT WORK:

### functions:
- "RENDERING NUMBER OF EXERCISES" - based on Exercise number(localStorage fn), render that many exercise in list.
- "MODIFYING VALUES" - on every exercise make it editable, when user click on e.g. "1. Push-ups", he can easly change it. Also user can modify number of sets, and based on it render the Sets list in length same as number given by user.
- "DELETLING" - By clicking on exercises list (right corner Thrash2 button), he can delete the exercise
- "ADD NEW EXERCISE" - by pressing add button, new exercise card will show up with "empty" values, that user can modify (name of exercise, number of sets, weigth, reps).

- "START EXERCISE" - after user complete making a training plan, he can start it, mark already done sets (after all sets of exercise are done), mark exercise done (show green style that will make user feel the exercise is done).



# *advanced:*
- "SAVE TRAINING PLAN" - user can save his training plan, and load it later.

- "LOAD TRAINING PLAN" - user can load saved training plan, and continue from where he left.

- "UPADATE STATISTIC" - after user finished the training add statistics to user profile (work with database so easly to monitor it)

- "Ready Training Plans" - *Create already made exercise plans , that user can copy and use in his own training plan*

# - to make some elements/components/function we will need to create database connection and use it and retrieve data e.g. Authentication user, retrieve data from database, assing training plans to user, adding friends etc.

- "" - Come up with how to save user's training plans, so he can access them later. | Come up with IDs system, every plan that generates, has own id and is assigned to user, so only X user can access it (in future -> adding other users to training plan). |
